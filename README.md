# Dispersal_mediates_fragmentation_sensitivity
Code and data associated with: Climate-driven variation in dispersal ability predicts responses to forest fragmentation in birds, Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution

All codes to recreate figures and associated analyses are provided.
Posterior samples from main models can be recreated through the codes in the Analyses folder. However, these can take a long time. 
Therefore, posterior samples files can be accessed on request from author, Tom L. Weeks (Posterior files too large to store in github).

Phylogenetic trees used for the the Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models can be downloaded from: https://birdtree.org/
